//Goal: The main use case for Primâ€™s algorithm is when you need to find a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected, undirected, weighted graph.
// MST Problem: You are asked to connect all the vertices of a graph with the minimum total edge weight, without forming any cycles.
// Example:
// Designing a network (e.g., laying out cables, roads, or pipelines) where you want to connect multiple locations at the minimum cost.
// Power grid design, where the objective is to connect power stations with minimum wiring costs.
// If your problem revolves around building a network of connections with the least cost, Prim's algorithm is a good choice.

// Example Usage
const graph = new Graph(5);

graph.addEdge(0, 3, 6);
graph.addEdge(1, 2, 3);
graph.addEdge(1, 3, 8);
graph.addEdge(1, 4, 5);
graph.addEdge(2, 4, 7);
graph.addEdge(3, 4, 9);

// Run Prim's algorithm
